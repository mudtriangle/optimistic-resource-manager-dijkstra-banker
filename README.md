# Optimistic Resource Manager and Dijkstra's Banker's Algorithm
Solution to Lab 3 of Operating Systems in NYU New York. It implements two different resource managing algorithms (FIFO and Banker's) and produces an output that compares them. Full description of the assignment is on the _assignment.pdf_ file.

## Details
Compilation tested with gcc 6.1.0.\
Sample inputs and sample outputs included. The algorithm is not supposed to produce outputs tagged as 'detailed', only the general outputs.

## How to Run
Compile through `Make`.\
To run after compilation: `./resmanager [input_file]`.
